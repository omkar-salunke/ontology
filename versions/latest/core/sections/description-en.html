<p>The diagram below shows an overview of the classes and properties of the ontology.</p>

<p>As an illustratrive example, we show how a dataset can be modeled with the Linked Earth Ontology. For example, consider the following table, which belongs to a dataset created by the author <i>Deborah Khider</i>.

<code>
LiPD-0989456_depth, LiPD-087654_MgCa, LiPD-076534_MgCaU, LiPD-053923_T, LiPD-8723456_TU<br/>

<p>
The table contains two main variables (<i>LiPD-087654_MgCa</i> and <i>LiPD-053923_T</i>), their uncertainty (<i>LiPD-076534_MgCaU</i> and <i>LiPD-8723456_TU</i>) and the <i>depth</i> at which the first one was measured. The second variable does not have an associated depth because it was inferred from the first one. According to the model, and assuming we know the rest of the metadata of the observation (i.e., the instruments and method used, the units in which every variable was measured, the archive, sensor and observation proxy the table refers to, etc.), we would represent the information as the following graph:
