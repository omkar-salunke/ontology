DataSet,"A collection of related information, including - but not limited to - geographical, chronological, and paleoenvironmental data",
Publication,"Metadata relating to the original publication in which the dataset was first presented.
One dataset can have more than one publication associated with it",
Funding,The source(s) of funding for the study,
Location ,The geographic data and metadata for the dataset,
Coordinates,"The geolocation of the study site in terms of latitude, longitude, and altitude. The coordinates can represent a single point, a line, or a polygon.",

DataTable,A set of Data organized in columns,
paleoDataTable,Table containig the PaleoData,subclass of DataTable
Variable,Quantities which can be measured or inferred independently in an experiment,
PaleoDataVariable,the paleodata variables,subclass of Variable
ClimateProxy,"Climate observations prior to the instrumental era are necessarily indirect. These observations are made on climate proxies in various geological (e.g. lake or marine sediments, living or fossil coral reefs, cave deposits), glaciological (ice cores or snow pits) or biological (trees) archives. Many types of measurements can be made on each archives, each sensing a different aspect of the environment (sometimes, several aspects at once). A paleoclimate dataset is a set of observations made on an archive.",
Archive,"The medium in which the response of a sensor to environmental forcing is recorded (e.g., marine sediments, ice core, lake sediments, speleothems). sensu Evans et al. (2013)",
Sensor,"The sensor comprises physical, chemical and/or biological components that react to environmental conditions (e.g, foraminifera, coral polyps, cave, catchment basin). sensu Evans et al. (2013)",
Observation,"The measurements made on the archives, whether chemical (e.g., Mg/Ca, d18O, TEX86, Sr/Ca....), physical (e.g. density, layer thickness) or biological (e.g. species abundance).",
PaleoDataArchive,The archive for the PaleoData,subclass of Archive
PaleoDataSensor,The sensor for the PaleoData,subclass of Sensor
PaleoDataObservation,The observations for the PaleoData,subclass of Observation
ClimateProxySystemModel,"In the Evans et al. (2013) framework, this is the combination of sensor, archive and observation models . ""A generalized proxy system model encapuslates a simplified representation of prior physical, chemical, biological, and/or geological understanding of the ways in which environmental variation ultimately results in the observations used to retrieve paleoclimatic information.""",
ArchiveModel,A mathematical description of how the sensor either creates or emplaces the signal into the archive (Evans et al. 2013),typical use: link to the doi of a publication (e.g. 10.1002/2015MS000447) or a piece of code (e.g. https://github.com/sylvia-dee/PRYSM/blob/master/psm/icecore/archive.py)
SensorModel,The behavior of the sensor in response to environmental forcing (Evans et al. 2013),e.g. https://github.com/sylvia-dee/PRYSM/blob/master/psm/icecore/sensor.py
ObservationModel,The way in which observations are made on the archive (Evans et al. 2013),e.g. https://github.com/sylvia-dee/PRYSM/blob/master/psm/aux_functions/analytical_error.py
